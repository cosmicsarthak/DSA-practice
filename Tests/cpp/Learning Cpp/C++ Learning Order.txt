The sequence in which I am Learning new things in C++.

Track of my C++ learning Journey==>

1. Syntax
2.Array
3.Vector
4.*max_element()
5.vec.begin() and vec.end()
6.Linear Search
7.Binary Search
8.Selection Sort
9.Bubble Sort
10. Use scanf instead of cin 
and use printf instead of cout
11. Use "\n" instead of endl
12. Use "ios::sync_with_stdio(false);" if using cin and cout
13. Use swap(sameVector.at(i), sameVector.at(j)) for interchanging the values of two elements 	  in a vector.
14. sort() in C++ STL
15.Insertion sort
16. Comparision between different Sorting Algorithms
17. Learnt Quick and Merge sort are the fastest sorting Algorithms and C++ std::sort() is the best and can be used in most cases
18. We can use "and" or "&&" in C++. Both have the same meaning in C++.
19. Heard about "auto" and "decltype" i.e Type Inference in C++
20. Learnt different Vector functions:reserve,insert,pop_back,epty,clear,erase,front,back
21. Heard about how to meassure execution time in C++ using std::chrono "#include <chrono>"
22.	Use "emplace()" instead of "insert" to add SINGLE elements inside a vector
23. Learnt Kadane's Algorithm for finding "Maximum Subarray Sum".
24. Learnt Matrix printing using Vectors
25. Learnt Matrix Transpose for both square and Rectangle matrix
26. Learnt Printing Matrix in spiral order using 4 different points: 	 Left, Right, Top, Bottom.
27. Learnt Multiplication of Matrix
28. Learnt Searching in 2D Matrix(Ordered Matrix) using "Top, Right" 	 or "Bottom, Left";
29. Learnt count_if in C++ <algorithm> STL.
30. Relearning again
31. Learnt to take unknown number of user inputs 
32. Learnt "find()" from <algorithm> and 'How it is better than "binary_search()" when the given vector is not sorted.
33. "string::npos" is used with find() in "string"
